# GPA_calculator
-This was My first big project that I have done The reason for this project was that we were worried about our GPA after returning to school following the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone was wondering about their grade, so I took the initiation to do something. First, I spoke with our college counselor about how to compute my GPA. He offered me some guide-lines. I began programming my GPA calculator using those rules, but most students, including my friends, laughed at me since they felt I couldn't do it. Over the weekend, I worked day and night to complete the first text-based version of the application. People were amazed, but not me. Since then, I've been updating it, and I'm currently learning KIVY, a Python graphical interface framework, to convert my application from text-based to graphical-friendly.
